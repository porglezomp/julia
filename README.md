Julia
=====
A parallel realtime Julia set renderer in Rust

Dependencies
--------
Requires the SDL2 library. This can be installed via most package managers or you can build from source by following the instructions at https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation.

If you are on MacOS and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can do `brew install sdl2`.

Controls
--------
* Move the mouse to define the key point of the Julia set.
* Use the up and down arrows to change the number of iterations.
It starts at 12. Even very low numbers (2-4) look really cool!
